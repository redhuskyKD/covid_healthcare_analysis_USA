## üß† Summary of Workflow & Findings

This project presents a full-stack data science workflow to assess healthcare infrastructure stress across U.S. Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) under projected COVID-19 scenarios. The analysis combines data engineering, visual analytics, and machine learning-based risk modeling, culminating in both interactive dashboards and interpretable AI models.

## üì• Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of hospital bed availability, ICU capacity, demographic information, and projected COVID-19-related needs at the HRR level. The CSV data was:

- Cleaned and merged using Python (Pandas)
- Imported into a MySQL database
- Cleaned further with SQL operations, including:
  - Duplicate row removal
  - Schema standardization
  - Type corrections (e.g., converting % strings to float)

## üìä Power BI Dashboard 1: Raw Healthcare Capacity Analysis

The cleaned SQL table was linked to Power BI, where the first dashboard was designed to provide exploratory insights into hospital infrastructure. Key visualizations included:

- **ICU Bed Metrics by HRR**: Available ICU beds, potentially available beds, and projected ICU needs over 6, 12, and 18 months
- **Population Distribution**: Adult population and those aged 65+
- **ICU Demand Stress**: Percentage of total ICU beds needed over 6, 12, and 18 months
- **HRR Slicer**: An interactive slicer to explore each region in isolation

---

## üßÆ Risk Analysis

A Multi-Criteria Weighted Index approach was used to score each HRR based on:

- ICU Stress  
- Hospital Stress  
- Surge Gap  
- Population 65+ Proportion  

This score was then categorized into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High Risk** levels for interpretability and policy use. The results were exported as `enhanced_risk_scored.csv`.

## üìà Power BI Dashboard 2: Risk-Level Visualizations

A second Power BI dashboard was developed using the enhanced risk-scored dataset to present insights into healthcare strain by risk category. Visualizations included:

- ICU Stress by HRR  
- Surge Gap Breakdown (Pie chart)  
- Ribbon Plot of ICU stress, Surge Gap, and Total Hospital Beds by HRR  
- Risk Label Distribution and related population statistics (Adults and 65+)

---

## üß¨ PCA Analysis

To understand variance and feature relationships, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was applied to the risk modeling features.

**Findings:**

- The first two components explained over **73%** of the total variance
- PCA plots visually confirmed **clustering by risk label**, validating feature selection
- A **3D PCA plot** and **K-Means clustering** further demonstrated the separability of HRRs by underlying healthcare stress patterns

---

## üîç SHAP Explainability

A tree-based classifier (**XGBoost**) was trained on the enhanced dataset. Using **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**, the model‚Äôs predictions were interpreted:

- **ICU Stress** and **Hospital Stress** emerged as the most important drivers of classification
- **Pop65 Proportion** helped differentiate Low and Medium risk
- **Surge Gap** had lesser but notable influence
- **Force plots** were used to interpret individual HRR predictions, enhancing trust and transparency

---

## üìå Final Remarks

The project demonstrates a robust pipeline from raw data to decision-support analytics by combining:

- **SQL** for structured data management  
- **Power BI** for real-time visualization  
- **Python** for data science and ML modeling  
- **SHAP** for AI explainability  

This modular, transparent approach enables health system planners, epidemiologists, and policymakers to monitor regional healthcare stress, prioritize interventions, and understand the driving factors behind risk assessments.
